üìÇ Project Structure

üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://[github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git](https://github.com/Vaishnaviwork/Police_Ledger_logs-Project)
    cd yourrepo
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your database:
    - Use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and create a table as described in the code.
    - Update the `db_url` in `Police_ledger_projectCode.py` with your credentials.

4. Run the dashboard:
    ```bash
    streamlit run Police_ledger_projectCode.py
    ```

Key Components

1. Data Collection & Storage
Data Source: Police traffic stop records, including details like stop date/time, location, driver demographics, vehicle information, violations, searches, and outcomes.
Database: Data is stored in a relational database (PostgreSQL) using a well-defined schema to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.

2.Data Processing & Cleaning
Python & Pandas: Used to clean and preprocess the data. This includes removing columns with only missing values, filling or dropping NaNs, and standardizing formats.
SQLAlchemy: Facilitates seamless interaction between Python and the SQL database for both data insertion and querying.

3. Database Design
Schema: The database schema is designed to capture all relevant aspects of a traffic stop, such as driver details, stop circumstances, and outcomes.
Normalization: Ensures data is organized efficiently, reducing redundancy and improving query performance.
We used render cloud platform to connect the DB.

5. Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)
Visualization: The dashboard displays raw data, summary statistics, and advanced analytics using tables and interactive charts (via Plotly).
Filters: Users can filter data by country, time, and other attributes for targeted analysis.
Advanced Insights: Predefined SQL queries provide insights such as:
Most common violations and vehicles
Arrest/search rates by time, country, or demographic
Trends by year, month, and hour
Demographic breakdowns and violation patterns
Prediction: Users can input new stop details to predict likely outcomes and violations using rule-based logic derived from historical data.

8. Analytics & Insights
SQL Queries: Advanced queries (including window functions and subqueries) are used to extract trends, compare day/night arrest rates, analyze violation patterns, and more.
Visualization: Results are visualized as tables, pie charts, and line charts for easy interpretation.

Project Goals & Benefits
Transparency: Provides a clear, data-driven view of police stop activity.
Efficiency: Enables quick lookups and analytics for operational decision-making.
Predictive Power: Assists officers in anticipating likely outcomes based on historical patterns.
Policy Support: Informs policymakers about trends and potential areas for intervention (e.g., high-risk times, demographic disparities).
User-Friendly: The Streamlit dashboard makes complex analytics accessible to non-technical users.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how modern data science tools can transform raw police log data into actionable intelligence. By integrating Python, postgreSQL, render and Streamlit, it delivers a robust, interactive platform for monitoring, analyzing, and improving police traffic stop operations.
